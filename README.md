Reflection

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I managed to achieve all non-stretch goal requirements and managed to create a website with dynamic routes to see specific parts of the data

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

Creating delete and edit buttons using the PUT and DELETE http methods. Also adding functionality to the "likes" section if the database

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Optional

Partly running out of time, and partly struggling to implement what an edit post feature would look like / be coded like on the client side.

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

General efficiency on code, how well did I utilize REACT, especially compared to last week. General feedback on styling

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

Couldn't fix an unintended design flaw where the "show more / less" button on the recipes page would conditionally render all recipes, and not just the one it is attached to, would like to know how to fix this

What went really well and what could have gone better?

I am overall proud of the functionality of the final product, although the pace at which things were done was slower than usual, as my REACT confidence wasn't super high
